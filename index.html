                        <p>"From discussions and interviews with SAP consultants of varying seniority, a pattern emerged. SAP consultants lacked
                        time to continuously learn SAP outside their work, which is vital for their career success. This led to the
                        inception of WeeklyTechPrep (WTP). The mission of WTP is to provide an easily accessible and continuous learning
                        experience for technology consultants. To achieve this, WTP will send SAP consultants a weekly SAP competency challenge
                        to solve, at an affordable yearly fee. I hope you find this tool of great service on your journey to SAP mastery."</p>

                        <p>All challenges and solutions are developed by module subject matter experts (SMEs). These SMEs are well known in their fields and have years of experience. We include the SME's social media accounts in case you want to chat with them and ask them questions.</p>

                        <p>Yes! While the challenges are designed for people who want to improve their SAP knowledge, WTP can still be a great
                        solution for those that are learning SAP. However, it is advised that it is used in conjunction with other learning
                        material (Such as SAP Learning Hub or SAP guides).</p>

                        <h3>Why not an educational platform like SAP Learning Hub or Udemy?</h3>
                        <p>If you’re new to learning SAP, you should go with a more thorough course that will teach you the
                        basics of your chosen SAP module and use WTP to complement your learning as WTP assumes that a student has the appropriate baseline knowledge. However, if you're a professional in the field already, then WTP can be a time and cost effective solution to SAP Learning Hub and Udemy.</p>

                    <div class="question-set">
                        <h3>Is WeeklyTechPrep really worth it?</h3>
                        <p>The answer depends on your seniority and location. The salary of a SAP Technical consultant is approximately $80,000 at
                        a company like IBM. If the chance of landing is 10% chance improved, then you would have paid $54 for an expected value
                        of $8,000. That’s approximately 148 times ROI.</p>
