                        <h3>Where are your challenges and solutions sourced from?</h3>
                        <p>All challenges and solutions are developed by module subject matter experts (SMEs). These SMEs are well known in their fields and have years of experience. We include the SME's social media accounts in case you want to chat with them and ask them questions.</p>

                        <h3>I do not have experience in SAP. Should I still subscribe?</h3>
                        <p>Yes! While the challenges are designed for people who want to improve their SAP knowledge, WTP can still be a great
                        solution for those that are learning SAP. However, it is advised that it is used in conjunction with other learning
                        material (Such as SAP Learning Hub or SAP guides).</p>

                    <div class="question-set">
                        <h3>Why not an educational platform like SAP Learning Hub or Udemy?</h3>
                        <p>If you’re new to learning SAP, you should go with a more thorough course that will teach you the
                        basics of your chosen SAP module and use WTP to complement your learning as WTP assumes that a student has the appropriate baseline knowledge. However, if you're a professional in the field already, then WTP can be a time and cost effective solution to SAP Learning Hub and Udemy.</p>

                        <h3>Is WeeklyTechPrep really worth it?</h3>
                        <p>The answer depends on your seniority and location. The salary of a SAP Technical consultant is approximately $80,000 at
                        a company like IBM. If the chance of landing is 10% chance improved, then you would have paid $54 for an expected value
                        of $8,000. That’s approximately 148 times ROI.</p>
